To compile these files, compile the either the 
array, link, or the heap function files with the 
main file.

Ex: g++ arrfunc.cpp main.cpp
	g++ linkfunc.cpp main.cpp
	g++ heapfunc.cpp main.cpp

I use the same header file for all three function
files. It was easier for me to understand it doing
it this way.
